# UDEP – Economics & Machine Learning: Selected Student Projects

This repository collects a small set of student projects from the course **“Introduction to Machine Learning with Python”** (Economics, Universidad de Piura).  
I supervised these projects and can vouch for the **code quality and use of ML methods**; they are not polished papers, but they are solid, well‑documented teaching examples.

## TL;DR – The projects

- 🇵🇪 **Core inflation nowcasting (Peru)**  
  → [Grupo 3 – ICD](https://github.com/yanirasilva-star/GRUPO-3-ICD)  
  Nowcasting **underlying (core) inflation** using BCRP data, expectations and the policy rate.

- 💱 **Crypto sentiment & USD/PEN exchange rate**  
  → [Grupo 8 – ICD](https://github.com/mirelli201914-del/TRABAJO-FINAL_GRUPO8_ICD)  
  Tests whether **global crypto market sentiment** (Fear & Greed Index) helps to explain movements in the **USD/PEN** exchange rate.

- 📝 **Honorary mention – Fiscal deficit, expectations & policy rate**  
  → [Deficit, expectations and BCRP reference rate](https://github.com/patrick8ms-wq/deficit-expectativas-tasa-referencia-bcrp)  
  Predicts business expectations at 3 and 12 months using fiscal deficit, expectations and the BCRP policy rate.

## Why these projects?

These projects were developed as final work for the course and:

- Use **clean, reproducible Python notebooks** (pandas, scikit‑learn, statsmodels, etc.).  
- Implement proper **train/test splits for time series**, baselines, and comparisons across linear and non‑linear models.  
- Include at least a basic **causal diagram (DAG)** to organize the economic story behind the data.

I have read the code, discussed it with the authors, and I’m comfortable recommending these repositories as **reference material for students and practitioners** who want to see how economic questions can be tackled with modern Python tooling.

For the honorary project on **fiscal deficit and expectations**, I understand and endorse the **programming and ML workflow**, but I do **not** claim deep expertise in fiscal‑deficit economics—so any macro interpretation of that project should be read with that caveat in mind.
